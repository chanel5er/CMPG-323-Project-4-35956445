# CMPG-323-Project-4-35956445

This project conducts user acceptance testing for a web application.
The tests are conducted via UiPath.

We start by building a process in UiPath that follows the sequence that users would usualy follow on the connected devices website. During the sequence we extract data from an excel sheet and use it to conduct our tests. We also test whether the operation has passed or failed. then right the results into an excel file.
